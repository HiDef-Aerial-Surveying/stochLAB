#' Geometric attributes at equidistant points within the rotor's unit circle
#'
#' @description Generates a list of grids containing geometric attributes of the
#'   rotor disk at equidistant locations, taking the center of the rotor as
#'   the reference point and overlaying the left-half of the rotor disk. The
#'   size of grid cells are determined by `xinc` and `yinc`, and their
#'   values map properties of the rotor at the cell's location.
#'
#' @details These grids are required for an alternative approach to the
#'   calculation of probability of collision under the extended model (i.e.
#'   non-uniform flight distribution at risk height).
#'
#'   Functions `xrisksum2`, `pcollxy` and `pcoll` used in Masden
#'   & Cook implementation (`PCollFunctions.r` script) were based on Visual
#'   Basic computations available in the original Band worksheet. This Visual
#'   Basic code was devised under a deterministic context, i.e. for one single
#'   set of collision calculations for one given species and turbine scenario.
#'   However, in a stochastic context, where potentially thousands of collision
#'   calculations are performed per species and turbine scenario, it became
#'   clear that `xrisksum2` and associated functions were highly
#'   inefficient for the task at hand.
#'
#'   The alternative approach streamlines computations by calculating (relative)
#'   rotor geometric attributes outside the stochastic sampling loop, which
#'   remain constant over iterations. These elements, calculated via
#'   `generate_rotor_grids`, are then applied to sampled parameters
#'   via vectorized operations. The number of calculations per iteration are
#'   thence substantially reduced, leading to significant gains in computational
#'   speed - over 30x faster than Masden's implementation for a 1000 iterations
#'   run.

#'   x-axis (i.e. grid cell dimensions)
